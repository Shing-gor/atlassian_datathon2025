*Project Brief: Analyze on a large-scale user behavior dataset without hints on desired outcomes.*

| Field | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** | • Visualized trends in customer acquisition, retention, and expansion over an 18-month period. <br> • Identified key user segments by analyzing feature usage patterns across different plan tiers and company industries. |
| **Machine Learning** | • Developed and trained two Random Forest models to predict `churn` and `upgrade` likelihood based on user attributes and behavioral data. <br> • Engineered a rich feature set from raw user, billing, and event logs to improve model accuracy and recall. |
| **Business Intelligence & Visualization** | • BI dashboards built by **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)**. <br> • Presented findings on MRR growth, acquisition channel quality, and the "leaky bucket" of new vs. churned customers. |
| **Strategic Solution** | • Proposed a targeted acquisition strategy to focus marketing spend on industry-specific channels that yield high-value, low-churn customers. <br> • Designed a proactive retention plan using model outputs to engage at-risk users before they churn. |

Secured **first place** out of 80 teams, with judges highlighting the solution as the most practical and commercially viable. The feedback commended the analysis for being concise, actionable, and directly relatable to real-world business challenges.
